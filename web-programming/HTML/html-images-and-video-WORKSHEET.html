  	<h1>Images and Video Worksheet</h1>
  	<h3>Important Note!</h3>
		<p>
			When you copy this worksheet up to your live server, remember that you must also copy the image files that you added to the images folder.
			If you don't do this, then your images will not appear when you view the page on your live server.
