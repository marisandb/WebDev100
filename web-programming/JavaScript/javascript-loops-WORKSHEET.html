	    <h1>JavaScript Loops Worksheet</h1>
	    <h2>Questions</h2>
	    <h4>Question 1</h4>
	    <p class="question">
	        What is the difference between a while loop and a for loop?
	    </p>
	    <div class="answer">
	        A while loop will iterate so long as the boolean expression is true. A for loop repeats a code block only a certain number of times.
	    </div>
	    <h4>Question 2</h4>
	    <p class="question">
	        What is an <b>iteration</b>?
	    </p>
	    <div class="answer">
	        Each time the code block executes is called an iteration. 
	    </div>
	    <h4>Question 3</h4>
	    <p class="question">
	        What is the meaning of the <b>current element</b> in a loop?
	    </p>
	    <div class="answer">
	        It is the element that is being processed within the body of loop - this changes with each iteration. 
	    </div>
	    <h4>Question 4</h4>
	    <p class="question">
	        What is a 'counter variable'?
	    </p>
	    <div class="answer">
	        A variable initialized to a number in the first part of a loop. 
	    </div>
	        <h4>Question 5</h4>
	    <p class="question">
	        What does the <b>break;</b> statement do when used inside a loop?
	    </p>
	    <div class="answer">
	        Allows you to terminate the loop early. 
	    </div>

    	You will use the array of 'employee' objects below to complete this problem.
    	
		Write a program that asks the user to search for employees in the array.
		Start by using the prompt() function to prompt the user to 'Enter the last name of the employee you would like to search for'.
		Then loop through the employees array.
		Inside the body of the loop, check to see if the last name of the 'current' employee is equal to the user input entered into the prompt.
		If the program finds an employee that matches the last name entered into the prompt, it should display all the properties of the matching employee in an alert box (you'll have to use string concatenation to do this).
		If the program does not find a matching employee, it should display an alert that says, "the employee you searched for is not in the system".
