<h1>Operators Worksheet</h1>
<p>Checkout <a href="https://www.remwebdevelopment.com/blog/javascript/javascript-operators.html" target="_blank">this page</a> to review the concepts we covered in class regarding operators.</p>
<h4>Question 1</h4>
<p class="question">
    What are the comparison operators used for?
</p>
<div class="answer">
    They can be used for boolean expressions. 
</div>
<h4>Question 2</h4>
<p class="question">
    Explain the difference between the logical AND operator (<b>&&</b>) and the logical OR operator (<b>||</b>).
</p>
<div class="answer">
    The AND operator evaluates if two boolean expressions are both true while the OR operator evaluates two boolean expressions to see if one or the other is true. 
</div>
<h4>Question 3</h4>
<p class="question">
    Which operator would you use to find the remainder from dividing 2 numbers.
</p>
<div class="answer">
    The modulus operator "%"
</div>
<h4>Question 4</h4>
<p class="question">
    Which operator would you use if you wanted to find out if two values were NOT equal?
</p>
<div class="answer">
    The inequality operator "!="
</div>

<h3>Coding Problems - See the 'script' tag below this h3 tag. You will have to write some JavaScript code in it.</h3>
<p>
    <b>Always test your work! Check the console log to make sure there are no errors.</b>

// CODING PROBLEMS
/////////////////////

//Problem 1
console.log("Problem 1");
//Declare a variable named 'score' and assign it a value of 21.
//Then use a short-cut arithmetic operator to add 7 to it.
var score = 21
score+=7
console.log(score)

//Problem 2
console.log("Problem 2");
//Use the decrement operator to reduce the value of 'score' by 1.
score--
console.log(score)


//Problem 3
console.log("Problem 3");
//Declare a variable named 'todaysHighScore' and initialize it to a value of 20.
//Then write an IF statement that checks to see if score is greater than todaysHighScore
//If it's true then alert("You beat the high score for the day!")
todaysHighScore = 20
if(score>todaysHighScore){
    alert("You beat the high score for the day!")
}
console.log('This problem generates an alert!')


//Problem 4
console.log("Problem 4");
//Use your imagination to declare and initialize a few variables and then demonstrate the logical AND operator in an IF statement
let weather = "Sunny"
let temp = 70

if(weather == "Sunny" && temp == 70) {
    console.log('The weather is '+ weather +' and ' + temp +' degrees. Beautiful weather today!')
}


//Problem 5
console.log("Problem 5");
//Use your imagination to declare and initialize a few variables and then demonstrate the logical OR operator in an IF statement
var average = 70
var finalGrade = 89

if(average > 70 || finalGrade > 70){
    console.log('Your average grade or final test grade was greater than 70, nice work!')
}
