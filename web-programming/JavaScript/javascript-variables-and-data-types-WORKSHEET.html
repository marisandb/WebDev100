            <h1>JavaScript Variables and Data Types Worksheet</h1>

            <b>Question 1</b>
            <p class="question">
                Find a reference that lists all the <b>keywords</b> in the JavaScript programming language.
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar">Reference</a>              
            </div>

            <b>Question 2</b>
            <p class="question">
                True or false: keywords are NOT case sensitive.
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                False
            </div>

            <b>Question 3</b>
            <p class="question">
                There are some rules for how you can name variables in JavaScript. What are they?
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                <ol>
                    <li>It must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore. It cannot start with a number</li>
                    <li>It can contain letters, numbers, dollar signs, or underscores. You cannot use a dash or period.</li>
                    <li>It cannot contain keywords or reserved words </li>
                    <li>Variable names are case sensitve so newItem and NewItem would be different variable names.</li>
                    <li>Use names that describe the information that the variable stores.</li>
                    <li>If the variable name is more than one word use camelCase or an underscore between the words.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <b>Question 4</b>
            <p class="question">
                What is 'camelCase'?
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                It is using an uppercase letter to begin any word after the first word of a phrase. For example: newVariableName 
            </div>      
            
            <b>Question 5</b>
            <p class="question">
                What are ALL the different <b>data types</b> in JavaScript (note that there are some that we did not discuss in class)? 
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                Numeric, String, Boolean, Arrays, Objects, Undefined, and Null. 
            </div>
            
            <b>Question 6</b>
            <p class="question">
                What is the <b>assignment operator</b> and why do they call it 'assignment'?
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                The equal sign (=) is the assignment operator. It is called this because it assigns or updates a value to the variable. 
            </div>
            
            <b>Question 7</b>
            <p class="question">
                What is a <b>boolean</b> data type?
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                It is either true or false values. 
            </div>
            
            <b>Question 8</b>
            <p class="question">
                What happens if you forget to put quotes around a string when you initialize a variable to a string?
                How does JavaScript try to interperet this?
                <br>
                For example: <b>var lastName = Jones;</b>
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                It will be undefined 
            </div>

            <b>Question 9</b>
            <p class="question">
                What character is used to end a <b>statement</b> in JavaScript?
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                Semicolon
            </div>

            <b>Question 10</b>
            <p class="question">
                If you declare a variable, but do not initialize it, what value will that variable store?
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                Undefined
            </div>            

            <h1>Coding Problems</h1>
            <h3>Coding Problems - See the 'script' tag below this h3 tag. You will have to write some JavaScript code in it.</h3>
            <p>Here are some tips to help you with the coding problems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To do this assignment, you'll need to know how to open the brower's developer tools (press F12) and look at the console log.</li>
                <li>Pay extremely close attention to syntax! One little syntax error can mess up your entire program.</li>
                <li>After you complete each problem, refresh the page in the browser and look in the console your log message and for errors.</li>
                <li>If you have an error in the console, check the line number of the error then look for syntax errors on that line (and the line before and the line after that line).</li>
                <li>
                    If you get stuck on this assignment, then ask for help.
                    Dealing with syntax errors can be extremely frustrating for beginners. It takes a lot
                    of help to start to get comfortable with the syntax of a language. Don't be afraid to ask for help, your success
                    in this class will depend on your willingnes to ask for help!

            // This means that you should save your code often and run it in the browser

            console.log("Problem 1");
            // Declare a variable with the name of myAge and initialize it to your current age.
            // Then log myAge. To 'log' the variable enter this code:

            // Now save this page in Sublime Text, and then open it in your browser.
