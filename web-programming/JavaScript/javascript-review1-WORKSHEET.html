            <h1>JavaScript Review</h1>
            <b>Question 1</b>
            <p class="question">
                There are two functions being called in the code sample below.
				Which one returns a value? How can you tell?
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-js">var grade = calculateLetterGrade(96);
submitFinalGrade(grade);</code></pre>
            <div class="answer">
                calculateLetterGrade returns a value. I know this because it has been assigned to a variable grade which will store the functions value.
            </div>

            <b>Question 2</b>
            <p class="question">
                Explain the difference between a <b>local variable</b> and a <b>global variable</b>.
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                A local variable is defined within a function and is only available to that function while a global variable is defined outside of any functions and is available to all functions and expressions. 
            </div>

            <b>Question 3</b>
            <p class="question">
                Which variables in the code sample below are local, and which ones are global?
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-js">var stateTaxRate = 0.06;
var federalTaxRate = 0.11;

function calculateTaxes(wages){
	var totalStateTaxes = wages * stateTaxRate;
	var totalFederalTaxes = wages * federalTaxRate;
	var totalTaxes = totalStateTaxes + totalFederalTaxes;
	return totalTaxes;
}</code></pre>
            <div class="answer">
                local: totalStateTaxes, totalFederalTaxes, totalTaxes
                global: stateTaxRate, federalTaxRate
            </div>

            <b>Question 4</b>
            <p class="question">
                What is the problem with this code (hint: this program will crash, explain why):
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-js">function addTwoNumbers(num1, num2){
	var sum = num1 + num2;
	alert(sum);
}

alert("The sum is " + sum);
addTwoNumbers(3,7);</code></pre>
            <div class="answer">
                The sum being called in the second alert is a locally declared variable within the addTwoNumbers function so it is not available outside of that function
            </div>

            <b>Question 5</b>
            <p class="question">
                True or false - All user input defaults to being a string, even if the user enters a number.
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                True
            </div>

            <b>Question 6</b>
            <p class="question">
                What function would you use to convert a string to an integer number?
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                parseInt()
            </div>

            <b>Question 7</b>
            <p class="question">
                What function would you use to convert a string to a number that has a decimal in it (a 'float')?
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                parseFloat()
            </div>

            <b>Question 8</b>
            <p class="question">
                What is the problem with this code sample:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-js">var firstName = prompt("Enter your first name");
if(firstName = "Bob"){
	alert("Hello Bob! That's a common first name!");
}</code></pre>
            <div class="answer">
               The if statement is using an assignment operator '=' instead of a comparison operator '=='
            </div>
            <b>Question 9</b>
            <p class="question">
                What will the value of x be after the following code executes (in other words, what will appear in the log when the last line executes)?
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-js">var x = 7;
x--;
x += 3;
x++;
x *= 2;
console.log(x);</code></pre>
            <div class="answer">
                20
            </div>
            <b>Question 10</b>
            <p class="question">
                Explain the difference between <b>truthy</b> and <b>falsy</b> values in JavaScript.
                Provide a few examples of both truthy and falsy values.
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                A truthy value is any variable that is storing a value; it will evaluate to true if used in a boolean expression. Falsey values are values like 0, null, undefined, NaN, or an empty string that will return as false when used in a boolean expression. 
            </div>
            <b>Question 11</b>
            <p class="question">
                One of the falsy values in JavaScript is <b>NaN</b>. What is NaN? When might you encounter a variable that is storing NaN?
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                NaN means not a number. When using parseInt and no number is being stored. 
            </div>

            <b>Question 12</b>
            <p class="question">
                Explain the difference between the <b>strict equality operator (===)</b> and the <b>equality operator (==)</b>.
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                The strict equality operator compares the value and the data types of two variables while the equality operator only compares the value of two variables. 
            </div>

            <b>Question 13</b>
            <p class="question">
                Explain the difference between <b>stepping over</b> and <b>stepping into</b> a line of code when using the debugger.
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
                Stepping over a line of code will execute the function and move onto the next line of code and stepping into is a line of code will take you to the function that is being invoked.  
            </div>
