	<h1>JavaScript Methods Worksheet</h1>

	<h4>Question 1</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    How is a method different from a regular function in JavaScript?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    It relates and exists within specifically to an object. 
	</div>
	<h4>Question 2</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    Why would we want to add methods to an object?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    To simulate an action that an object can take. 
	</div>
	<h4>Question 3</h4>
	<p class="question">
	    How can we access the property of an object from inside the body of a method of that object?
	</p>
	<div class="answer">
	    Using the dot operator. (Ex: dog.bark() accesses the object dog and method bark)

	/*
	Problem 1
	Create an object that simulates a letter (as in a letter that you send via US Mail)
	Add the following properties and their values:

	  PROPERTY NAME         PROPERTY VALUE
	  --------------------------------------------
	  toName                Betty Johnson
	  toAddress             1224 Main Street
	  fromName              Charles Jones
	  fromAddress           212 N. Park Ave.
	  message               Hello Betty, Please call me when you can, Chuck

	Then add a method named 'print'.
	The body of the print method can simply log the values of each property in the object.
	Finally, invoke the print() method.
	*/
	var letter = {
		toName: 'Betty Johnson',
		toAddress: '1224 Main Street',
		fromName: 'Charles Jones',
		fromAddress: '212 N. Park Ave.',
		message: 'Hello Betty, Please call me when you can, Chuck',
		print: function(){
			console.log(this.toName)
			console.log(this.toAddress)
			console.log(this.fromName)
			console.log(this.fromAddress)
			console.log(this.message)
		}
	}

	letter.print()


	/*
	Problem 2
	Declare a variable named bankAccount, the data type of the variable should be an object.
	Add a property named 'balance' and assign a value of 0 to the property.
	Add a method named 'deposit' to the object.
	  -The method should include a parameter named 'amount'
	  -In the body of the method, increase the 'balance' property by the amount parameter

	Now invoke the deposit() method a few times (and pass in a value for the amount to deposit each time you invoke the method).
	Finally, console log the 'balance' property
	*/
	var bankAccount = {}

	bankAccount.balance = 0
	bankAccount.deposit = function(amount){
		this.balance = this.balance + amount
	}

	bankAccount.deposit(10)
	bankAccount.deposit(15)
	bankAccount.deposit(25)

	console.log(bankAccount.balance)

	/*
	Problem 3
	Use your imagination to create an object that you might simulate real-world data in a program.
	Add at least two properties that are not methods.
	Add at least one method, the method can simply log a simple message to the console that would describe what the method would do in a real program.
	Make sure to invoke the method after you create the object.
	*/

		bathrooms: 1.5,
		needsMaintenance: function(number){
			console.log('Call and schedule maintenance for townhouse #' + number)
